(๑╹っ╹๑) I am very passionate about programming and computers in general. I'm actually going to school for Computer Science so I can professionally program Artificial Intelligence (AI). ⸜( ˙˘˙)⸝

I want to create a huamn-like android one day. (ㅅ´ ˘ `) I also have plans to create a mobile/web-based application that fuses AI and psychotherapy; specifically using an AI as an "on-the-go" psychotherapist, a little program to talk to when you need something like emotional support.
